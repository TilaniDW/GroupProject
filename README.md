## Can a leading UK packaging distribution company reduce costs by bringing deliveries in-house?

This was a real-world business project, and by far the most collaborative one I worked on. Along with three other analysts, we partnered with a leading UK Packaging Distribution Company to assess whether transitioning from third party couriers to an in house delivery model would be financially and operationally viable. 
Due to the sensitive nature of the data, we signed an NDA, so while I can‚Äôt disclose specific figures, I can share the analytical approach and key insights gained throughout the project.

From the start, our team ‚Äì ‚ÄòLogiKit Analysts‚Äô, leveraged complementary skills to divide responsibilities effectively. I contributed by ensuring data quality and analysis structure, as well as applying Python and Excel for key calculations. I also brought some creativity into the project by designing our team logo and report visuals. We met biweekly via Google Meet, using Google Docs to collaborate efficiently while keeping each other updated through WhatsApp.

Our analysis focused on three main areas:
1. Profit Impact ‚Äì Evaluating whether an in-house delivery model could lead to cost savings and improve operational efficiency.
2. Fleet Optimisation ‚Äì Determining the optimal fleet size and vehicle types needed to sustain in-house deliveries within a 50-mile radius.
3. Freight & Route Efficiency ‚Äì Using Google API, Python, and Tableau to model delivery distances, customer demand clusters, and cost per mile to identify the most economical delivery zones.

We worked with Excel and Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to clean and merge e-commerce and delivery data, and used Google API to calculate precise delivery distances. Using K-Means clustering, we analysed customer density to optimise delivery routes, and employed predictive modelling to estimate fleet costs and profitability across different delivery scenarios. At the mid-project review, we presented initial findings and incorporated feedback to refine our approach. By the final presentation, we had developed clear, data-driven recommendations outlining an optimal fleet strategy and identifying specific routes that would be most profitable for in-house management. The employer was particularly impressed by our scenario modelling and clustering analysis, which provided a structured, evidence-based strategy for decision-making.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply data analytics to a real-world logistics and supply chain challenge, reinforcing my skills in Python, Excel, API integration, Tableau, and business storytelling. Most importantly, it strengthened my ability to collaborate in a high-stakes, team-driven environment while delivering insights that could have a tangible business impact.

### Employer Feedback

‚Äú*Exceptional work. Some slides were data-heavy, but I‚Äôd be happy for this to be shown to the business. Great job breaking down the data by geographical area and analysing how many vehicles can operate per day. Smart insights, particularly from a value perspective. The fleet estimates were accurate. Well done incorporating feedback from the dry run, making the information more readable.*‚Äù
